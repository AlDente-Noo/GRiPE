# GRiPE - Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes and Eukaryotes
The computational tool that simulates the dynamics of DNA-binding proteins. 
The project is based on Gene Regulation in Prokaryotes (GRiP, https://github.com/nrzabet/GRiP), but unlike GRiP, it includes short-range repressors which can make a small DNA region inaccessible for other proteins.
